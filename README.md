## ðŸš€ Setup and Deployment

This project is designed to be run with Docker and Docker Compose, which is the recommended method.

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

This is the simplest and most reliable way to run the bot. It packages the application and all its dependencies into a single container.

**Prerequisites:**

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yujboss/het-uz.git](https://github.com/yujboss/het-uz.git)
   cd het-uz
   ```

2. **Create Your Configuration File:**
   Rename the example config file and fill in your credentials.
   ```bash
   mv config.py.example config.py
   ```
   Now, edit `config.py` with your details (`HET_USERNAME`, `HET_PASSWORD`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`).

3. **Build and Run the Bot:**
   Use Docker Compose to build the image and start the container in the background.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```
   Your bot is now running!

**Managing the Bot with Docker:**

* **View Logs:** `docker-compose logs -f`

* **Stop the Bot:** `docker-compose down`

* **Start the Bot:** `docker-compose up -d`

### Manual Setup (Legacy)

This method is for running the bot directly on a machine without Docker.

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   It's recommended to use a Python virtual environment.
   ```bash
   # Create and activate a virtual environment
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install the required Python packages
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Google Chrome:**
   The scraper uses Selenium to control a web browser. For Debian/Ubuntu systems:
   ```bash
   wget [https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb](https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb)
   sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
   sudo apt-get install -f
   ```

3. **Configure and Run:**
   Follow Step 2 from the Docker setup to create and edit your `config.py` file. Then, run the bot:
   ```bash
   python3 bot.py
   ```
