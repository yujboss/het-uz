## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the bot up and running on your own server.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine or server:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yujboss/het-uz.git](https://github.com/yujboss/het-uz.git)
cd het-uz
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
It's recommended to use a Python virtual environment to keep your project's dependencies organized.
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is included in the repository. If you add new packages, you can update it by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.)*

### 3. Install Google Chrome
The scraper uses **Selenium** to control a web browser. This script is configured to use Google Chrome, so it must be installed on the system where you run the bot.

**Why is this needed?** Selenium automates a real browser to log in and navigate the website just like a human would. The script runs Chrome in "headless mode," meaning it does all its work in the background without needing a graphical display, which is perfect for servers.

To install it on a Debian/Ubuntu system, run the following commands:
```bash
# Download the installer
wget [https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb](https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb)

# Install the package and any missing dependencies
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

### 4. Configure the Bot
All configuration is handled in the `config.py` file. A template is provided to make this easy.

1.  **Rename the example file:**
    ```bash
    mv config.py.example config.py
    ```
2.  **Edit `config.py`** with a text editor (like `nano` or `vim`) and fill in your details:
    -   `HET_USERNAME` & `HET_PASSWORD`: Your login credentials for the het.uz portal.
    -   `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Your unique token from Telegram's BotFather.
    -   `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Your personal chat ID, so the bot knows where to send messages.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Bot
Once everything is configured, you can start the bot with this command:
```bash
python3 bot.py
```
The bot will now run continuously, listening for commands and sending scheduled reports. For long-term use, it's recommended to run this process in the background using a tool like `screen` or `tmux` to ensure it stays active even after you disconnect from the server.

-   `/start` - Displays a welcome message and confirms the bot is running.
